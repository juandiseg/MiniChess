DESCRIPTION
--------------------------------
This is a minichest game that we had a bit over a week to develop. It is basically a reduced version of chess, but it still implements all rules and has most of the pieces from the original game. There is a more precise description of this coursework in "Week 21-25; Assessment -110.pdf".
